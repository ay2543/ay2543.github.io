We're going to make some plotly plots.

## Load packages and data


```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

Let's get some data.

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  select(borough = neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, price, room_type, lat, long, rating) %>% 
  filter(
    borough == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500
  ) %>% 
  drop_na(rating)
```

Let's make a scatterplot!

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(
    text_label = str_c("Price: ", price)
  ) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, # ~ indicates lat is a variable
    y = ~long,
    color = ~price,
    type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    alpha = 0.5,
    text = ~text_label
  )
```
